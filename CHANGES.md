## [Friend](http://github.com/clojusc/friend) changelog

### `0.2.4`

* Updated to latest stable releases of dependencies (note that beta
  dependencies are not being used in this release, in particular, `ring`
  1.6.0-beta; the next release of `friend` will use the latest `ring`, even if
  it's still in beta)

### `0.2.3-transitional`

* Updated to document the new Clojars group ID
* Changed URLs to point to new project home
* Provide developers a zero-risk path (no code changes) to using the project
  under the new maintainer

### `0.2.3`

* Deprecated and un-documented friend's "channel security" features. You should
use https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-ssl instead, probably via
https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring-defaults.

### `0.2.2`

* Bumped some dependencies to prevent fatal errors when used in conjunction with
other libraries, certain versions of Clojure (gh-116, gh-127)
* OpenId workflow can now be initialized via an HTTP GET request (contra the
spec?) to interop with existing SSO systems (gh-114, gh-44)
* `wrap-authorize` now requires its role parameter to be non-empty (gh-99)
* `robert-hooke` is now properly classified as a test dependency (gh-106)

There are other changes, please see the [full list of issues resolved leading up
to this release](https://github.com/clojusc/friend/issues?q=milestone%3A0.2.2+is%3Aclosed),
and the commit history if you're super-interested.

### [`0.2.1`](https://github.com/clojusc/friend/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=closed)

* Added `:cemerick.friend/ensure-session` as an optional slot workflows can add
  to the metadata on authentication maps they return. By default, Friend will
  update (or set anew) the Ring session when a user is authenticated,
  redirecting them to where they were originally headed before hitting an
  authentication requirement. By setting `:cemerick.friend/ensure-session` and
  `:cemerick.friend/redirect-on-auth?` to `false`, the user will not be
  redirected, and the session will not be set. This addresses the use cases of
  both the HTTP Basic workflow, as well as use cases where a request is made
  simply to establish authentication without a redirect, but while retaining the
  session-setting behaviour. (gh-83)
* Fix the HTTP Basic workflow so that non-Basic authentication mechanisms that
  use the `Authorization` HTTP header can be used (gh-85)
* Workflows are now only ever run as needed (gh-90)
* Port numbers are no longer set if `X-Forwarded-Proto` is present in the
  original request (gh-84)

### `0.2.0`

Friend now depends upon Ring 1.2.0 final.  This means (due to the transitive
dependency on [tools.reader](https://github.com/clojure/tools.reader)) that
Friend now requires Clojure 1.3.0+.

This release contains a significant refactoring of the library to follow the
interceptor pattern adopted by Ring 1.2.0 (see the note under "Misc" below).
Note that this refactoring is _not_ a breaking change, either from an end-user
or workflow author/maintainer standpoint.

**Core API**

* The `default-unauthenticated-handler` now properly retains the query string of
  the initial requested unauthenticated URL (gh-68)

**Workflows**

* The OpenID workflow can now be used much more reliably behind reverse proxies
  and load balancers:
  * The `return_to` URL now automatically takes into account any
    `x-forwarded-proto` header provided by your reverse proxy
  * If your proxy/load balancer doesn't send `x-forwarded-proto` headers, then
    you can use middleware to add an appropriate `return_to` URL to the request
    going into the OpenID middleware, keyed under
    `:cemerick.friend.openid/return-url` (gh-74)
* The interactive-form workflow now properly picks up `username` parameter value
  after a failed login attempt (gh-69)

**Misc**

* Friend's middlewares have been refactored internally to implement an
  interceptor pattern, to match Ring's middlewares >= 1.2.0.  This makes Friend
  suitable for use with e.g. Pedestal and similar frameworks. (gh-54)

### `0.1.5`

Friend is now tracking Ring v1.2.0 betas, minimally requiring
`[ring/ring-core "1.2.0-beta1"]`.

**Core API**

* `:roles` in authentication maps may now optionally be a function returning a
  collection of roles (gh-21, gh-55)

**Workflows**

* All included workflows now properly account for the in-force Ring context, if
  any. (gh-52, gh-53, gh-56)

### `0.1.4`

**Core API**

* Fixed handling of the optional authorization-error map that may be provided
  to `authorize` (gh-46)

**Misc**

* Various minor documentation improvements.

### `0.1.3`

**Core API**

* `cemerick.friend/current-authentication` can now accept either a ring request
  map or a Friend identity map
* `cemerick.friend/authenticated` can now accept more than one body form
  (gh-32)
* A new `cemerick.friend/authenticate` option, `:unauthenticated-handler`,
  allows one to provide a separate Ring handler to control how to respond to
unauthenticated requests when authentication is required (either via setting
`:allow-anon` to `false`, or via use of `cemerick.friend/authenticated`). The
prior behaviour (redirecting to the URI specified by `:login-uri`) is currently
retained by the default `:unauthenticated-handler`,
`cemerick.friend/default-unauthenticated-handler`. (gh-38)

**Workflows**

* The `http-basic` workflow no longer produces a 401 Unauthorized response when
  no HTTP Basic credentials are supplied. (gh-38)
* The OpenID workflow now offers a `:consumer-manager` option for providing a
  fully-configured `org.openid4java.consumer.ConsumerManager` (to be used
instead of the in-memory default) (gh-35)
* Usernames provided as part of an interactive-form workflow authentication are
  now URL-encoded in the resulting redirect when authentication fails (gh-41)

**Misc**

* New function `cemerick.friend.credentials/bcrypt-verify` now available to
  verify bcrypt-hashed strings outside of
`cemerick.friend.credentials/bcrypt-credential-fn` and the
workflow/authentication process
* All HTTP redirect responses sent by Friend now use an absolute URL in the
  `Location` header per the HTTP spec (gh-42)
* The transitive dependency on Google Guice (needed by the openid4java
  dependency) has been updated to use the coordinates available via Maven
Central

### `0.1.2`

**Core API**

* Credential functions may now return maps with a
  `:cemerick.friend.credentials/password-key` slot in their metadata to
indicate the key within the credential map itself which holds the password.
* The value of the `:cemerick.friend/redirect-on-auth?` key in workflow may now
  be a string URI to which the user will be redirected (instead of the
`:default-landing-uri` provided to the `authenticate` middleware).
* Friend now plays much nicer with Ring sessions; in particular, it no longer
  quashes session data set by lower-level handlers and middleware.  (gh-24,
gh-26)

**Workflows**

* The `http-basic` workflow now properly supports empty usernames and passwords
  (gh-28)

### `0.1.1`

Bricked, don't use.

### `0.1.0`

**Core API**

* `:login-uri` now actually defaults to `"/login"` as indicated in
  documentation (Yoshito Komatsu, gh-13)
* Authorization failures are now handled more sanely (gh-19):
  * `:unauthorized-redirect-uri` is no longer used (was nonsensical)
  * additional data may now be added to the stone thrown upon unauthorized
    access (see `cemerick.friend/authorize`, `cemerick.friend/authenticated`,
and `throw-authorized`)
  * data added to stone thrown by `cemerick.friend/throw-authorized` is now
    added to the request passed to `:unauthorized-handler` in the
`:cemerick.friend/authorization-failure` slot
* HTTP 401 is now used instead of 403 to properly indicate unauthorized
  authenticated request (gh-20)
* `cemerick.friend/logout*` is now public (John Szakmeister)

**Workflows**

* http-basic workflow now properly responds with www-authenticate challenge when
  no credentials are provided and `:allow-anon?` is false (gh-16)
* the OpenID workflow's `:max-nonce-age` must now be specified in milliseconds
  instead of seconds
* the OpenID workflow no longer adds unprintable objects to the ring session

**Misc**

* Documentation for `cemerick.friend/identity` fixed
